# ControlTheoryBreadbotProject
Project for PHYS 420 Control Theory

In this project, we are attempting to drive a RedBot through a defined distance and then stop it as quickly as possible. All files uploaded here depend on the Arduino and Sparkfun RedBot libraries, along with others that will be accessed as needed.
